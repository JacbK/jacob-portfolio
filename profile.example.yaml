notes: |
  I'm a full-stack engineer who recently left a startup to work on developer tools.
  I care a lot about DX and performance. Most of my projects are CLI tools and libraries.

  I'm targeting roles at infrastructure companies (Vercel, Railway, Render type places).

  Design inspiration: Linear's website, Stripe docs, Rauno's portfolio

  Highlight these projects:
  - my CLI tool for managing monorepos (5K stars)
  - the performance optimization work I did at my last startup
  - my open source contributions to Next.js
